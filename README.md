# Belly Button Diversity Dashboard 
In this module, we we expanded upon our JavaScript skills by utilizing Plotly to create interractive charts showcases various findings throughout one dataset.  

To view the dashboard, please use the GitHub pages link below:


Aside from there being many bacterial species in our belly buttons that are unknown to mankind as of yet, some of the bacteria found have proteins that can synthesize and taste like beef. The charts below are the findings of a microbiologist who is studying the various bacteria within belly buttons, searching for the one that could change the artificial meat industry forever. The microbiologist started by analyzing the types and amounts of bacteria cultures found per sample in realtion to how many times the belly button is typically washed. Then, they were able to identify the top ten bacteria cutlures found per sample.

After building the three charts, I leveraged my knoldge of HTML and Bootstrap to add a background image to the jumbotron header, added a paragraph of additional context about the dashboard, and changed the layout so that each chart had enough space to be interracted with.
